Example of cleansing HTML using AntiSAMY
========================================

This is a small example program that uses AntiSAMY policy files to cleanse input of unwanted HTML.

ie., "<p>Hello World</p><script>alert("Test")</script>" becomes "<p>Hello World</p>"

This is useful for allowing formatted text but avoiding XSS vulnerabilities.
